# Integer
# As big (small) as supported by your Memory and Operating system

number = -12
numbers = 123

# We can convert types to Integer with int()

# Float
# As big (small) as supported by your Memory and Operting System

fixedNumber = 0.3

# We can convert types to Float with float()

## Write long numbers in easily readable way: 1_000_000.00
## Ex.

bigNumber = 1_000_000

### Basics Operators 
### + # Works with strings
### 2 + 2 = 4
###
### - 
### 2 - 2 = 0
###
### * # it works with strings if applied correctly
### 2 * 2 = 4
###
### / # it throws a float as a output
### 2 / 2 = 1
###
### // # it automaticly cut decimal space
### 2 // 2 = 1
###
### ** # power a^x
### 2 ** 2 = 4
###
### % # modulus operator 
### 2 % 2 = 0

#### Using strings 
#### Two types 
#### 1) "" ; 2) ''
#### 1) only letters ex. 'Dominik'
#### 2) characters and letters ex. "I'm Dominik."

##### Lists
##### ex. 

someList = []

##### the rule is the same as in the other langueages, it starts with index: 0
